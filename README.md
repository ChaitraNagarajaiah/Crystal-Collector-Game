Crystal-Collector-Game is a Javascript app that uses the Math.floor(Math.random()) function to generate a random target number between 19 and 120. There are 4 crystals displayed on the screen.For each round, the user will receive a new target number, and each crystal will be assigned a new value.
Theuser does not know the crsyal value until clicking on it. The goal for the user is to click on different crystals so that the sum adds up to the target number for that round.
